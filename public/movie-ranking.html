<h1>The Best Movie According to Annette</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>It is a korean movie which garnered a lot of awards in Oscar.It's all about class conflict and wealth inequality.
Some of the scene is quit intense and frightening.</p>


<h3>Romeo and Juliet</h3>
<p>Who would not love this tragic love story of all time.</p>

<h4>Mr.and Mrs.Smith</h4>
<p>In this movie i saw the connection between the main actor and the actress.You can really see the strong attraction between them two.</p>
